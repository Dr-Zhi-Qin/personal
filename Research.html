		<h2>Research Summary</h2> 

		<p>
			      <strong>Part one</strong> (bound to bound transitions): The way light travels through an atmosphere is moderated by the ability of the constituent species to absorband emit radiation. Each atom and molecules does this in at a unique and characteristic set of wavelengths which both facilitates their detection at large distances and means that they contribute uniquely to the properties (opacity) of the atmosphere. The way hot molecules interact with light is particularly complicated involving millions or even billions of so-called lines. Compilation of comprehensive and accurate lists of these lines are key to probing the physical properties and conditions of remote environments，including understanding radiative transport in our atmosphere (eg for models of the climate change and monitoring of pollution), the characterisation of atmospheres of (exo)planets orbiting other stars, and so on.

		<p>

			<strong>Part two</strong> (bound to free transitions): The fragmentation of a bound molecule through absorption of one or more photons is called photodissociation. The electromagnetic energy of the light beam is converted into internal energy of the molecule and if the transferred energy exceeds the binding energy of the weakest bond, the molecule will irreversibly break apart. Photodissociation is at the heart of photochemistry. In many cases, the photofragments are radicals which rapidly undergo secondary and tertiary reactions. Photodissociation is the motor for many important chain reactions determining the complex chemistry in the atmosphere. At present, There are very little data on the photodissociation of hot molecules (and their UV absorption in general) which, due to thermal vibrational excitation, is expected to occur at significantly longer wavelengths than at room temperature.

		<p>
			<strong>Part two</strong> (free to bound transitions): To form a stable molecule by association of two colliding fragments, energy must be removed or else the fragments will eventually dissociate again. Energy can be removed by a third body and by emission of a photon, where the latter process is termed radiative association. Radiative association is a ubiquitous process for forming molecules, albeit not so well known as on Earth it is normally outcompeted by three body collisions. In interstellar space however, particularly in regions with little dust (few grains), it can be important.

				Radiative association for the formation of MgO
			</h3>

			<p>
				The radiative association process for the formation of MgO may be of great importance due to its frequent occurrence in the low-density and dust-poor astrochemical environments. In this work, the cross sections and rate coefficients for the A1Π → X1Σ+, X1Σ+ → A1Π, D1Δ → A1Π, a3Π → e3Σ-, X1Σ+ → X1Σ+ and A1Π → A1Π radiative association processes of forming MgO are theoretically estimated. The cross sections for the transitions between the different states are obtained by using the semiclassical method for direct contributions and the Breit-Wigner theory as a complement for resonance contributions. For the transitions between the same states, the quantum mechanical method is used. The rate coefficients are then obtained from the cross sections for the temperatures in the range of 10-10000K and the results are found to vary from 4.69×10-16 cm3s-1 to 6.27×10-14 cm3s-1. For temperatures lower than around 693K, the rate coefficients for the A1Π → X1Σ+ process are dominant, which indicates this process is the most efficient way of producing MgO at low temperatures. However, the rate coefficients for the D1Δ → A1Π process go through a rapid increase with increasing temperature and become dominant at higher temperatures. For other processes, their rate coefficients are several orders of magnitude lower than those for the two processes mentioned above. The results can be used to further investigate the formation and evolution of MgO in low-density and hot gas close to the photosphere of evolved oxygen-rich stars. <a class="text-link" href="pdf/Bai et al. 2021 MNRAS(1).pdf"><b>Related Paper</b></a>

			<h3> 
				Line lists for the X2Σ+-X2Σ+, A2Π-A2Π and A2Π-X2Σ+ transitions of CP
			</h3>

			<p>
				Rovibrational energy levels of CP are investigated for its X2Σ+ and A2Π electronic states. Rovibronic frequencies observed experimentally for the A2Π-X2Σ+ transition are used to produce empirical energy levels with the MARVEL method (denoted as MARVEL energy levels). The MARVEL energy levels for the X2Σ+ and A2Π states are then employed to fit the empirical potential energy curves (PECs), spin orbit coupling curves (SOCCs) and electronic angular momentum curves (EAMCs) by using DUO program , also constrained by the corresponding ab initio curves. Meanwhile, empirical Born-Oppenheimer breakdown curves, spin-rotation curves (SRCs), Λ-doubling curves are also added to well reproduce the MARVEL energy levels. These curves referred to as analytical spectroscopic models are as an input to DUO to obtain the fitted energy levels for the X2Σ+ and A2Π states and the line lists for the X2Σ+-X2Σ+, A2Π-A2Π and A2Π-X2Σ+ transitions. Partition functions for temperatures up to 5000K are computed by using the fitted energy levels and fitted by polynomial expansions. The calculated MARVEL energies can be used for spectroscopic investigations of the interstellar CP radical in various astrophysical sources, especially in circumstellar envelopes and warm clouds. The rovibrational energy levels and line lists derived from the analytical spectroscopic models can be used for predicting spectroscopy at temperatures up to 5000K for potential applications in related plasmas. <a class="text-link" href="pdf/Qin et al. 2021 JQSRT.pdf"><b>Related Paper</b></a>
